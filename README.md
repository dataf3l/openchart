# OPEN CHART: AZ Command Generator

This is an Open Source tool quick and easy for cost estimation of DevOps Infrastructure on Azure
It allows it's useas to easilly and conveniently create a topology diagram of the desired network
and generates a cost estimate and a list of tasks for the devops teams (it generate AZ Commands).

This tool can be later extended to estimate costs for other problems such as User Interface cost
estimation, Mobile application cost estimation and templated task generation for the team, and
perhaps even can be used for Interior decorators to help their customers estimate roughly the cost
of renovations.

We hope you'll find it useful, so we published it under Public Domain (a permissive license).
